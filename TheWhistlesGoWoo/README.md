Although many non-experts contribute the majority of these sports gambling predictions, they may be expected to have low predictive power. However, it has been shown empirically that by aggregating these non-expert opinions, usually by taking the arithmetic mean or the median of the set of estimates, the resulting collective estimate can be highly accurate.

For sports betting, we envision that we can all benefit from this platform.  For example, suppose White Sox are +135 against the Guardians. This means that if you bet $100 dollars on the White Sox you will have a payout of $235.  If the crowd says you will win 43% of the time or more, this is a great bet to take because your expected profit might be positive.
