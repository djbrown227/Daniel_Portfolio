# NBA Daily Fantasy Sports(DFS) Model

## Introduction
The intersection between sports, gambling and analytics has grown exponentially over the past decade. Creating my own NBA DFS gambling model in Python has given my a view into this world and great learning experience. It has also been a realization that there is alot to learn in data science, and one major portion of understanding is domain knoweledge. I hope to continue to improve and develop my model to gain greater insight into basketball and NBA DFS, while also improving my data science techniques.  

## Project Overview
Over the last few months I have created a profitable NBA DFS model that earns 1.5% ROI daily on DraftKings. I created an A-Z gambling model, that encompasses every element of the DFS process. This enables me to accurately and efficiently enter NBA DFS competitions, while allowing time to adjust to last minute injuries and NBA news. The model I built includes:
1. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/djbrown227/Daniel_Portfolio/tree/main/Python%20Programming%20Projects/NBA%20Daily%20Fantasy%20Sports)
2. [Player Projections](https://github.com/djbrown227/Daniel_Portfolio/tree/main/Python%20Programming%20Projects/NBA%20Daily%20Fantasy%20Sports/Player%20Projections)
3. [Lineup Optimization](https://github.com/djbrown227/Daniel_Portfolio/tree/main/Python%20Programming%20Projects/NBA%20Daily%20Fantasy%20Sports/Lineup%20Optimizer)

## What is Daily Fantasy Sports?
DraftKings holds NBA DFS competitions every night a NBA basketball game is scheduled. Participants in the competition have to choose 8 players from the teams competing that night. They must choose 1 Point Gaurd, 1 Shooting Gaurd, 1 Small Forward, 1 Power Forward, 1 Center, 1 Gaurd(Point Gaurd/Shooting Gaurd), 1 Forward(Small Forward/Power Forward), and 1 Utility Player (this can come from any position). DraftKings assigns a Point Projection and Salary for each player. The goal is to maximize DFS points while keeping the lineup salary under $50,000.

The contests vary, but most competitions pay out to the top 25% of each competition with the winnings heavily weighted 1% of each competition.
