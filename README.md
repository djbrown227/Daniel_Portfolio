## Background

Hello! 

My name is Daniel Brown and welcome to my Project Portfolio! I will tell you about myself briefly. I did my undergraduate degree at The City College of New York where I majored in Applied Mathematics with an emphasis on Financial Mathermatics. I am currently enrolled in the Maters of Data Science program with the University of Colorado at Boulder(online). Diving deep into the field of Data Science in the past year has led me to a newfound interest into where data analytics, sports performance and gambling meet. Over the past year I started a gambling adjacent company called TWGW LLC as an aide to sports gamblers. Also, I have created a working and profitable Ddaily Fantasy Sports model for NBA basketball. 
 
I would my next foray into this data analytcs to be within a defined role in an organization I believe in. I hope to add my creativity and passion to the organization while also gaining experience into how large successful organizations apply data analytics to solve problems.
