## Intro
A/B testing is a statistical method used to compare the performance of two or more different versions of a product, marketing campaign, or website. 
It involves randomly dividing a sample of users into groups, showing each group a different version of the product or campaign, and measuring the performance 
of each version. The goal of A/B testing is to identify which version is more effective at achieving a desired outcome, such as increased conversion rate, 
higher customer satisfaction, or greater engagement. A/B testing is a powerful tool for making data-driven decisions and improving the performance of products 
and campaigns. It is commonly used in the fields of marketing, product development, and user experience design.
