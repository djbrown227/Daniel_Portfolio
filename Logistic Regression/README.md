# Intro
Logistic regression is a statistical method used to predict binary outcomes, such as whether an individual will default on a loan or whether an email is spam. It models the probability of an event occurring based on input variables and uses a logistic function to produce a probability between 0 and 1. This probability can then be used to classify the event as either a "success" or a "failure." Logistic regression is commonly used in fields such as finance, marketing, and healthcare.
