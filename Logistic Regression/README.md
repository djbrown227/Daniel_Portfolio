# Intro
Logistic regression is a statistical method used to predict binary outcomes, such as whether an individual will default on a loan or whether an email is spam. It models the probability of an event occurring based on input variables and uses a logistic function to produce a probability between 0 and 1. This probability can then be used to classify the event as either a "success" or a "failure." Logistic regression is commonly used in fields such as finance, marketing, and healthcare.

## NBA PLayoffs
Logistic regression is a statistical method used for predicting binary outcomes, such as whether a basketball team will win or lose a game. It does this by using a logistic function to model the probability of an event occurring based on certain input variables. In the context of the NBA playoffs, logistic regression could be used to predict the likelihood of a team winning a playoff series based on factors such as their regular season record, their scoring efficiency, and the strength of their opponent. By analyzing these variables and using logistic regression to model their probability of winning, analysts and fans can make more informed predictions about the outcomes of the playoffs.
