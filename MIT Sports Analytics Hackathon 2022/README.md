# Python Projects

## Introduction

Python has been a great tool for getting introduced to the power of data analysis. At first I used it for basic univariate analysis, but have recently utilized it to build machine learning models that have improved my ROI in NBA Daily Fantasy Sports gambling. More recently I have used to to explore other interests of mine and hope to continue using it in my career.
