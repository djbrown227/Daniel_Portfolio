# The Whistles Go Wooo Gambling Website

## Introduction
The Whistles Go Woo website provides an aid for sports gamblers to Harness the wisdom of the crowd to predict sport outcomes and get an edge over the sportsbooks.

## Background
The concept of the wisdom of the crowd stems from the fact that although many non-experts contribute to the majority of these sports gambling predictions their aggregate predictions are often highly accurate. The individual may be expected to have low predictive power, however, it has been shown empirically that by aggregating these non-expert opinions, usually by taking the arithmetic mean or the median of the set of estimates, the resulting collective estimate can be more accurate than expert opinions, in our case this would be the sportsbooks.

This concept dates back statistician Francis Galton. In 1906 country fair in Plymouth, 800 people participated in a contest to estimate the weight of an ox. Statistician Francis Galton observed that the median guess, 1207 pounds, was accurate within 1% of the true weight. Current research has shown that this concept can be applied to probabilistic outcomes, specifically sport outcomes.

## The Whistles Go Woo Project Description
Our goal was to provide people a platform to harness the wisdom of the crowd to predict sport outcomes. We based our questions on sportsbooks lines.

The user would come to our site and make their predictions. In order to entice people to the site and to make predictions, we created contests with prize money the person with the best predictions.

After a person made their predictions they were able to see what the crowd predicted.

How can people utilize this information? If the crowd's prediction is greater than the implied probability of the sportsbook line than the bet should be made.
For example, suppose White Sox are +135 against the Guardians. This means that if you bet $100 dollars on the White Sox you will have a payout of $235. The implied prbability is 42.5%.  If the crowd says you will win 43% of the time or more, this is a great bet to take because your expected profit is positive. For sports betting, we envision that we can all benefit from this platform.
