## Background

Hello! 

My name is Daniel Brown and welcome to my Project Portfolio! I will tell you about myself briefly. I did my undergraduate at The City College of New York where I majored in Applied Mathematics with an emphasis on financial mathermatics. I am currently enrolled in the Maters of Data Science program with the University of Colorado at Boulder(online). Diving into Data Science in the past year has led me to a newfound interest into where data analytics, sports performance and gambling meet. Over the past year I started a gambling adjacent company called TWGW LLC as an aide to sports gamblers. List website. Also, I have created a working and profitable Ddaily Fantasy Sports model for NBA basketball. 
 

Now I focus on programming for whatever problems come my way, automating my life wherever I can and conducting analysis on topics that interest me!
