# The Whistles Go Wooo Gambling Website

## Introduction
The Whistles Go Woo website provides an aid for sports gamblers to Harness the Wisdom of the Crowd to Predict Sport Outcomes and get an edge over the sportsbooks.

## Background
The concept of the Wisdom of the Crowd stems from the fact that although many non-experts contribute the majority of these sports gambling predictions, they may be expected to have low predictive power. However, it has been shown empirically that by aggregating these non-expert opinions, usually by taking the arithmetic mean or the median of the set of estimates, the resulting collective estimate can be highly accurate.

The concept dates back statistician Francis Galton. In 1906 country fair in Plymouth, 800 people participated in a contest to estimate the weight of a ox. Statistician Francis Galton observed that the median guess, 1207 pounds, was accurate within 1% of the true weight. Current research has shown that this concept can be applied to probabilistic outcomes, specifically sport outcomes.

## The Whistles Go Woo Project Description
Our goal was to provide people a platform to harness the wisdom of the crowd to predict sport outcomes. The user would come to our site and make their predictions

For sports betting, we envision that we can all benefit from this platform.  For example, suppose White Sox are +135 against the Guardians. This means that if you bet $100 dollars on the White Sox you will have a payout of $235.  If the crowd says you will win 43% of the time or more, this is a great bet to take because your expected profit might be positive.
