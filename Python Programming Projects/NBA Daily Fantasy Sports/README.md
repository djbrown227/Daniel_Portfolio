# NBA DFS Model

## Quick Intro
Within the last few mmonths I have created a profitable NBA DFS model that earns 1.5% ROI daily. I performed Exploratory Data Analysis on this dataset,
created projections using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression, and utilize an mixed integer optimizer to select lineups for each DFS slate.

## Problem Statement

How to create a profitable NBA Daily Fantasy Sports Model.

## Approach
Utlize a DataBase to keep data secure and organized
Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis
I used feature selection to find the features that were useful in my models. 
I trained my models on 1 season worth of nba data
I then used Linear regression and Random Forest Regression to make DFS point projections.
I entered these projections into a mixed integer optimizer in order to select my lineups
I used Games Started, Minutes, Average Fantasy Points, to 
I regularly backtest my models to ensure accuracy.

## Result
ROI of 1.5% Daily

## Importance
The intersection between sports, gambling and analytics has grown exponentially over the past decade. By continuing to make sports decisions informed by analytics it
ensures a su. It is
