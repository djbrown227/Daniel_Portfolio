# Intro
Multiple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables. Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression, which models the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable.
