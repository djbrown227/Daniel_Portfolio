# NBA DFS Exploratory Data Analysis

## Introduction
In the Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) of the NBA Data I explore player and team DFS data through univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. This data was aquired through Stathead.com. My intended goal is to get a feel for the data through visualizations and analysis. The end goal for EDA is to select features that affect DFS points for each player. 

## DFS Player Analysis
#Goal
After importing data from Stathead.com, I calculated DFS points for each player for each game of the season. I used univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis tools to achieve this. My intended goal is to get a feel for the data and find features in the standard box score data that may have predictive power for DFS points for future games.

## DFS Team Analysis
#Goal
After importing data found from Stathead.com, I calculated DFS points per game for each team so far this season. I used univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis tools to achieve this. My intended goal is to get a feel for the data and find features in the team standard stats data that may have predictive power for DFS points for future games.
