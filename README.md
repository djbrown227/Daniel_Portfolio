## Background

Hello! 

My name is Daniel Brown and welcome to my Project Portfolio! I will tell you about myself briefly. I earned my undergraduate degree from The City College of New York where I majored in Applied Mathematics with an emphasis in Financial Mathermatics. I am currently enrolled in the Maters of Data Science program with the University of Colorado at Boulder(online). 

Diving deeper into the field of Data Science over the past year has led me to a newfound interest into where data analytics, sports performance and gambling meet. Over the past year I started a gambling company called TWGW LLC that offered aide to sports gamblers decision making. Also, I have created a working and profitable Daily Fantasy Sports model for NBA basketball. 
 
I would like my next foray into the field of data analytcs to be within a defined role in an organization I believe in. I hope to add my creativity and passion to the role while also gaining experience into how large successful organizations apply data analytics to solve problems.
