## Intro
Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique that involves generating multiple random scenarios and evaluating their outcomes. It is used to model and 
analyze systems with uncertainty, such as financial markets, weather patterns, and complex systems with many variables. Monte Carlo simulation can be used to 
project future outcomes, evaluate risk, and optimize decisions by analyzing the distribution of possible outcomes. It is based on the idea of using random 
sampling and statistical analysis to estimate the probability of different outcomes. Monte Carlo simulation is widely used in a variety of fields, including 
finance, engineering, and science, to model and analyze complex systems and make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty.
