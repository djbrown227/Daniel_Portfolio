## Intro
K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning method used to partition a dataset into a predefined number of clusters. It works by iteratively assigning each
data point to the cluster with the nearest mean, recalculating the mean of each cluster, and repeating the process until convergence. K-means clustering is commonly 
used for exploratory data analysis and for finding patterns or groupings in data. It is a fast and simple method, but it can be sensitive to the initial starting 
points of the clusters and may not always produce the most optimal clusters.
