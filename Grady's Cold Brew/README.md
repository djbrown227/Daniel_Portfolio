## Intro
As shipping manager at Grady's Cold Brew I undertook a cost saving proect that saved the company 15% on shipping costs. Grady's offered free shipping to customers for
orders over $40 and customers paid for their shipping for orders under $40. The shipping department policy was to use UPS Ground for orders over $40 because it was 
presumed to have a lower rate of delivery failure than our other main option, UPS SurePost. UPS Ground was significantly more expensive than UPS SurePost, by about 
15-25%. In undertaking this cost saving initiative my aim was to look into this claiim of reliability and see if it was valid.

## Methodology
1. Randomly select 100 UPS Ground and 100 UPS SurePost orders from the past year
2. Check each order for failure. This required checking each tracking number for confirmed delivery
3. Find mean failure of each sample
4. Perform null hypothesis test, where the null hypothesis is that both failure rates are the same
5. Check p-value

## Results
Given the results of the null hypothesis test there is not a difference in delivery failure rates between UPS Ground and UPS SurePost. Given this, 
and after convening with the operations manager, it was decided that all packages would be sent via UPS SurePost because of the cost savings.
I found that we could save between $1.85 and $3.57 a delivery, which would results in savings of between $15,000 and $25,000 a year.
Further, these savings would increase linearly as Grady's shipping department grew.
