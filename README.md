# Darwin Agunos - Projects Portfolio

## Index

This repository holds all of my personal projects that I've done over the years. Currently they're binned in three different categories

1. [Personal Programming Projects](https://github.com/darwin-a/PersonalProjects/tree/master/Personal%20Programming%20Projects)
    - [Python](https://github.com/darwin-a/PersonalProjects/tree/master/Personal%20Programming%20Projects/Python)
      - Data Science
      - Scripts
      - Software Development
2. [CPP Education Research](https://github.com/darwin-a/PersonalProjects/tree/master/Physics%20Education%20Research)
3. [Public Tableau Visualizations](https://github.com/darwin-a/PersonalProjects/tree/master/Tableau%20Public%20Visualizations)

Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by some form of documentation. 

## Background

Hello! 

My name is Darwin Agunos and welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little bit about me. I did my undergraduate at Cal Poly Pomona where I majored in Physics with an emphasis on applications computational sciences. In my undergraduate studies I was a Physics Education Researcher where I spent my time analyzing the effectiveness of certain instructional pedagogies on student performance, sentiment analysis on students perceptions of the physics-math intersection in quantum mechanics and the analysis of how demographics affect student performance (e.g. gender/racial gaps in student performance). 

Now I focus on programming for whatever problems come my way, automating my life wherever I can and conducting analysis on topics that interest me!
