# NBA Daily Fantasy Sports(DFS) Model

## Quick Intro
Over the last few months I have created a profitable NBA DFS model that earns 1.5% ROI daily on DraftKings. I created an A-Z gambling model, that encompasses every element of the DFS process. This enables me to accurately and efficiently enter NBA DFS competitions, while allowing time to adjust to last minute injuries and NBA news. The model I built includes:

2. [Player Projections]()
3. [Lineup Optimization]()

## What is Daily Fantasy Sports?
DraftKings holds NBA DFS competitions every night a NBA basketball game is scheduled. Participants in the competition have to choose 8 players from the teams competing that night. They must choose 1 Point Gaurd, 1 Shooting Gaurd, 1 Small Forward, 1 Power Forward, 1 Center, 1 Gaurd(Point Gaurd/Shooting Gaurd), 1 Forward(Small Forward/Power Forward), and 1 Utility Player (this can come from any position). DraftKings assigns a Point Projection and Salary for each player. The goal is to maximize DFS points while keeping the lineup salary under $50,000.

The contests vary, but most competitions pay out to the top 25% of each competition with the winnings heavily weighted 1% of each competition.

## Goal
## Approach
Utlize a DataBase to keep data secure and organized
Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis
I used feature selection to find the features that were useful in my models. 
I trained my models on 1 season worth of nba data
I then used Linear regression and Random Forest Regression to make DFS point projections.
I entered these projections into a mixed integer optimizer in order to select my lineups
I used Games Started, Minutes, Average Fantasy Points, to 
I regularly backtest my models to ensure accuracy.

## Result
ROI of 1.5% Daily

## Importance
The intersection between sports, gambling and analytics has grown exponentially over the past decade. By continuing to make sports decisions informed by analytics it
ensures a su. It is

## Introduction

Python has been a great tool for getting introduced to the power of data analysis. At first I used it for basic univariate analysis, but have recently utilized it to build machine learning models that have improved my ROI in NBA Daily Fantasy Sports gambling. More recently I have used to to explore other interests of mine and hope to continue using it in my career.
